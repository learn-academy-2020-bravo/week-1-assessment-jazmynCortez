# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: tells the computer what to do with variables it's given

  Researched answer: A function is a set of instructions detailing how to do a task



2. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: filter goes through the index and only outputs the indexes you chose to have at the end exactly. (I'm not sure how to describe map and their differences...)

  Researched answer: map function iterates through an array and returns a new array of the same length rather filter function loops through an array and returns a new array with only the values that are truthy or the values that satisfy your stated condition.



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() is used when debugging mostly because information gets inputed to the log that goes into the function to make the function do something, rather a return is part of the function.

  Researched answer: console.log() is a function that logs the arguments you pass to the web console and a return is a statement which specifies the value returned from a function



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: an argument is what goes inside the () right?....

  Researched answer: argument is a value passed to a function when the function is called



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming is when there are 2 people working on one project with 2 monitors at the same time. There is a driver who will be thinking and doing the steps that are right ahead and there is a navigator that will be looking and making the overall picture is getting done correctly.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently



6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: TDD is like pseudocode but it is used when using jest. When using TDD it always starts with a describe statement, a test statement, and an expect statement.

  Researched answer: Test-driven development is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass.



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Pair programming is helpful because it helps stick concepts into my brain. I need to however go over some things more to understand when to use things to solve a problem. Work on googling my questions and being able to form my questions properly so they're able to be answered.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React - is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Yarn - is an Apache Hadoop technology and stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator
- React State - The heart of every React component is its “state”, an object that determines how that component renders & behaves
- CRUD - such as retrieve instead of read, modify instead of update, or destroy instead of delete
- this - is a variable that is used in instance methods to refer to the object on which they are working.
